            We utilize the possibility of company appearances on social and

            platform by clicking on the respective network icon displayed on our
            Websites, which includes a hyperlink. A hyperlink activated by
            clicking on it opens the external destination in a new browser
            window of your browser. No personal data is transferred to the
            respective network before this activation. 4.1. Visiting our page on

            aforementioned network or platform is, in principle, solely
            responsible for the processing of personal data when you visit our

            contact us via one of the networks or platforms if you wish to avoid
            this. You use such networks and platforms and their functions on
            your own responsibility. 4.2. Communication via social media and
            professional networks and platforms We process information that you
            have made available to us via our company page on the respective

            details, communication content, job title, company name, industry,
            education, contact options, photo, and other data you voluntarily
            provide to us. The (user) names of the registered network or
            platform users who have visited our company page on the networks or
            platforms may be visible to us. Legal basis: If you contact us as
            part of an existing contractual relationship or contact us in
            advance for information about our range of services, the personal
            data will be processed for the performance of a contract or in order
            to take steps prior to entering into a contract and to respond to
            your contact request in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sent. 1 lit.
            b GDPR. Otherwise, the legal basis for the processing of the
            personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 sent. 1 lit. f GDPR. The personal
            data is processed to pursue our legitimate interests in responding
            appropriately to customer/contact inquiries. Duration of storage: We
            will delete your personal data as soon as the purpose for data
            storage and processing no longer applies (e.g., after your request
            has been processed). However, in some cases, e.g., due to legal
            retention periods we might be under the legal obligation to continue
            the storage of your personal data.

            We might transfer your personal data to certain data receivers if
            such transfer is necessary to fulfill our contractual and legal
            obligations. In individual cases, we transfer personal data to our
            consultants in legal or tax matters, whereby these recipients act
            independently in their own data protection responsibilities and are
            also obliged to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and other
            applicable data protection regulations. In addition, they are bound
            by special confidentiality and secrecy obligations due to their
            professional position. In the event of corporate transactions (e.g.,
            sale of our business or a part of it), we may transfer personal data
            to involved advisors or to potential buyers. Additionally, we also
            use services provided by various specialized companies, e.g., IT
            service providers, that process data on our behalf (hereinafter
            “Data Processors”). We have concluded a data processing agreement
            according to Art. 28 GDPR or EU standard contractual clauses of the
            EU Commission pursuant to Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR with each
            service provider and they only process data in accordance with our
            instructions and not for their own purposes. Our current Data

          <Typography>
            Your personal data is generally processed in Germany and other
            countries within the European Economic Area (EEA). However, it may
            also be necessary for personal data to be transferred to recipients
            located outside the EEA, i.e., to third countries, such as the USA.
            If possible, we conclude the currently applicable EU standard
            contractual clauses of the EU Commission pursuant to Art. 46 para. 2
            lit. c GDPR with all processors located outside the EEA. Otherwise,
            we ensure that a transfer only takes place if an adequacy decision
            exists with the respective third country and the recipient is
            certified under this, if necessary. We will provide you with
            respective documentation on request.
