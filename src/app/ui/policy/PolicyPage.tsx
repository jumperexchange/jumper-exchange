            storage and processing no longer applies (e.g., after your request
            has been processed). However, in some cases, e.g., due to legal
            retention periods we might be under the legal obligation to continue
            the storage of your personal data.

            We might transfer your personal data to certain data receivers if

            consultants in legal or tax matters, whereby these recipients act
            independently in their own data protection responsibilities and are

            applicable data protection regulations. In addition, they are bound
            by special confidentiality and secrecy obligations due to their
            professional position. In the event of corporate transactions (e.g.,
            sale of our business or a part of it), we may transfer personal data
            to involved advisors or to potential buyers. Additionally, we also
            use services provided by various specialized companies, e.g., IT
            service providers, that process data on our behalf (hereinafter
            “Data Processors”). We have concluded a data processing agreement
            according to Art. 28 GDPR or EU standard contractual clauses of the
            EU Commission pursuant to Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR with each

            Your personal data is generally processed in Germany and other
            countries within the European Economic Area (EEA). However, it may
            also be necessary for personal data to be transferred to recipients
            located outside the EEA, i.e., to third countries, such as the USA.
            If possible, we conclude the currently applicable EU standard
            contractual clauses of the EU Commission pursuant to Art. 46 para. 2
            lit. c GDPR with all processors located outside the EEA. Otherwise,
            we ensure that a transfer only takes place if an adequacy decision
            exists with the respective third country and the recipient is
            certified under this, if necessary. We will provide you with
            respective documentation on request.
